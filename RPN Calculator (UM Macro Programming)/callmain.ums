//At the end of compilation, sets r0 and r2 
//to zero and the end of the stack respectively.
//So that at start of the next section, these
//registers are set and ready to be used. Calls main
//within calc40.ums file to start the main program.

.section init
    r0 := 0
    r2 := endstack
    goto main linking r1 using r5, r6 //call main
