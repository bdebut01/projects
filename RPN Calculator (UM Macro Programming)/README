Everything has been correctly implemented, though I will admit I am
unsure if the "largest possible negative number" that Ramsey cautions
about in the specifications has been dealt with. My program runs repeated
1000000 random value tests and outputs identical code to the solution, so
I am assuming everything is working correctly.

No departures from the calling convention, however I did decide not to use 
a value stack. And gave r3, r4 very specific roles in the program.

My recursive print module pushes (then later pops) the ones digit 
of each word by modding by ten, then shifting the number down a 
power of ten and repeats until ones digit only.
