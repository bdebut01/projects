### Latest update

The slider now limits the actual visit data instead of solely whether or not that entire country has been visited. Presently this is only visible in the infobox details which will only show details of travels up to the slider's date--instead of all visits to that country.


### TODO

- Infobox
-- Include relevant interesting info
-- Style internal elements by category with font size, bold, etc
- Country opacity increase with # of visits
- Farther down the line:
-- Animations, specifically one to make it clearer when a country has been visited
-- Radio buttons/dropdown for different people's travels
