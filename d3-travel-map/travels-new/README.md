### Latest update

List visits so far and the date of the visit in the infobox.


### TODO

- Infobox
    - Style internal elements and adjust container to fit internal content
- Darken countries by number of days there instead of number of visits. See Bostock's [Choropleth example](https://beta.observablehq.com/@mbostock/d3-choropleth)
    - Special case US to be max darkness
- Farther down the line:
    - Animations, specifically one to make it clearer when a country has been visited
    - Radio buttons/dropdown for different people's travels
