-- image_transform.py --
Transforms images using multiple threads to process and affect an image
in some way. On the command line, the order of arguments is as follows:
 > filename.jpg (of which you are processing)
 > out.jpg (the file to write the new image to)
 > transformation (the transformation you want to perform on the image)
 > optional 3 & 4th arguments that stipulate how one wants to break
 	down the image thread-wise. 

If you opt out of the 3rd and 4th arguments, it defaults to 2 rows and
2 columns. If you provide one additional argument, you MUST provide the
other.

Example working commands:

python image_transform.py cat.jpg out.jpg switch-r-b 3 10
python image_transform.py rainbow.jpg new_rainbow.jpg bw

The three operations are:
switch-r-b : swaps the red and blue values in the image.
boost_red : boosts the color red in the given image.
bw 	  : turns a color image black and white.
