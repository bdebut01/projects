Gives each instrument a thread and has all threads wait for every other thread
to play each note before proceeding to the next note. 

Assuming the input text file is in the expected format:
/src/instrument1 |xxxx3xx|...and so on
/src/intrument2 |xxxx4xxxxx|....
Most important is that the source of the music file and the start of the
music is separate by a space. For rests in the music, any non-numerical
character suffices. The program expects '|' for line delimeters and would 
interpret other delimeters as rest notes.

On the command line the program takes 1 argument, a text file.
